# Update Note: CaMa-Flood v4.1

## Versions (2023.01.02)
Current official release on webpage is v4.01
Latest GitHub branch (master)  is v4.10

## Update in v4.00 (compared to v3.6)
- Major Version Update
- New code structure for more flexible model use
- Topography data updated to **MERIT DEM / MERIT Hydro**

## Update in v4.01 (2021.03.31)
### Importants changes for all users
- **GitHub** code management started.
- **bugfix** in map/src/src_param (src_region) /**generate_impmat.F90**.
